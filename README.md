Pr√°ctica 2
================
1.-Run and gather execution time (4 or 5 samples), then draw a graph (with Calc, octave, gnuplot).

Result Data:
1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 
Quick: 0.004, 0.004, 0.004, 0.004, 0.01, 0.07, 0.505
Bubble: 0.004, 0.004, 0.004, 0.026, 1.159, 1m31s, explode

Result File: ej2/Results.jpg

2.- modify the code in github and program the comparison (take more samples).

Result file: ej2/Big_o.cpp

3.- upload results to your github account. 

OK

4.- write a Makefile for the code.

Result files: Makefile and CMake.txt

5.- Create the loops that the exercises (loop_exercises.cpp) don't implement
Transform loops in the exercise to ranged loops

Result file: loop_exercises.cpp
